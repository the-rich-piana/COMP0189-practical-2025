    "### Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the \"Womxn in Big Data South Africa: Female-Headed Households in South Africa\" challenge from the Zindi platform. The dataset has been developed using the data from the 2011 census in South Africa by aggregating different key indicators that are relevant in the context of the proposed task and that intuitively should have some connections - e.g. home type, school attendance, access to piped water, language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since South Africa comprises over 4 thousand wards (i.e. geopolitical subdivisions of the country), each feature in the dataset represent ward level information, such as the prevalence of different types of dwellings in a certain ward, the prevalence of different population groups in a certain ward, or the prevalence of women-headed households with an annual income lower than $2.3K in a specific ward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challange associated with this dataset consists of developing a Machine Learning model that using the dataset features can predict the percentage of female-headed households in a ward that have an annual income lower than approximately 2.3 thousand dollars at the time the data was collected (https://zindi.africa/competitions/womxn-in-big-data-south-africa-female-headed-households-in-south-africa). \n",
